# Call Confirmations
Have you ever accidently called a Group DM alerting 3+ friends of your heinous transgression? Have you ever tried looking at the pinned messages in your DM's only to accidently call that person you don't really like? With Call Confirmations, you can avoid embarrassment by making sure you actually meant to call someone. The plugin also works for Server VC's too!

By default, only Group DM confirmations are enabled, however, in the config, you can choose what types of confirmations you want enabled!
